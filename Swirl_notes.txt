| You can exit swirl and return to the R prompt (>) at any time by pressing the
| Esc key. If you are already at the prompt, type bye() to exit and save your
| progress. When you exit properly, you'll see a short message letting you know
| you've done so.

| When you are at the R prompt (>):
| -- Typing skip() allows you to skip the current question.
| -- Typing play() lets you experiment with R on your own; swirl will ignore
| what you do...
| -- UNTIL you type nxt() which will regain swirl's attention.
| -- Typing bye() causes swirl to exit. Your progress will be saved.
| -- Typing main() returns you to swirl's main menu.
| -- Typing info() displays these options again.

Upon completing each lesson, swirl will ask for your Coursera credentials:

    Course ID: rprog-011
    Submission login (email): The email address associated with your Coursera account
    Submission password: This is NOT the password that you use to log into the Coursera website. Your submission password can be found at the top of the Programming Assignments page.
    Programming Assignment page: https://class.coursera.org/rprog-011/assignment


| To begin, you must install a course. I can install a course for you from the
| internet, or I can send you to a web page
| (https://github.com/swirldev/swirl_courses) which will provide course options
| and directions for installing courses yourself. (If you are not connected to
| the internet, type 0 to exit.)

| If at any point you'd like more information on a particular topic related to
| R, you can type help.start() at the prompt, which will open a menu of
| resources (either within RStudio or your default web browser, depending on
| your setup). Alternatively, a simple web search often yields the answer
| you're looking for.

| To notify Coursera that you have completed this lesson, please upload
